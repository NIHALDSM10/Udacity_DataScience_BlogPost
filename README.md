## Overview

Through this project, I've done a quick overview of the Seattle Airbnb Data [(here)](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) while using the CRISP-DM process (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).

## Motivation

This is an introductory project as part of the Data Science Nanodegree program at Udacity. Through this project, I've done exploratory data analysis of the Seattle Airbnb dataset. This project was a great way to understand the CRISP-DM project. I started off the project asking a few questions, cleaned and prepared the data, and explained my results through a blog post. Below is a list of questions I was interested in:

1. What is the distribution of rental type in Seattle?
2. Which are the most expensive and cheapest neighborhoods in Seattle?
3. What time of the year is the busiest and most expensive in Seattle?
4. Is there any correlation between the number of listings and the average price of the listings in a particular area?

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook which follows the CRISP-DM framework

## Blog Post

I've explained my approach and analysis through a [blog](https://nihalshah1996.medium.com/seattle-airbnb-overview-de79f9461138) on Medium

## Analysis Summary

1. Entire home/apt is the most popular type of room listing (3,344 (81.4%) out of 4,107 listings fall under this category).
2. Magnolia is the most expensive neighborhood with the average price per night per listing around 186. Interbay is the least expensive neighborhood with the average price per night per listing around 85.
3. June, July and August seem to be the most expensive period to visit Seattle. This makes sense since this is right between Summer and Fall when the days are the longest in Seattle and it does't get dark around 3pm like it does during the winter months (Jan - Mar)
4. Below is the correlation matrix between the number of listings and the average listing price. As you can see, there's a slight positive correlation with the number of listings and the average price of the listings in a particular area.
